# ideas, just so that i don't forget

Data structures, let's goooo

This is where I'll store ideas I have. I want to add a similar functionality to my personal website and add UI to it, but for now, I'm gonna keep it this way.
The ideas can be publishable and non-publishable.

- The publishable ones include Jupyter notebooks that I commit to a repo called neural-nets-intro (and other repos), changes to my website, articles on medium, and so on.
- Non-publishable ones are about learning something without necessarily making it public, if that makes sense.

Some ideas I have are vague and may sound crazy, but I'm gonna keep them.

I hope that having my ideas stored publicly will make me more accountable and productive.
